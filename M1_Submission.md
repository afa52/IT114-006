<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Talk about what you learned during this module, anything interesting, new, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I got a better understanding on the git pull and push requests and<br>what their job is. I find it pretty interesting the idea of writing<br>code and then testing it in the terminal, this is something new for<br>me. I also never even knew that there was a data type called<br>short, and was actually unfamiliar with the conditions for each of the data<br>types, so I will definetely be reviewing those more in depth. I always<br>knew what github is but actually putting it to use in ways I<br>never learned makes github a much more interesting platform that I am excited<br>to learn about.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Did you have any issues? If so, how did you resolve them? If no issues, just type "no issues".</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>At first, I had a hard time pushing my commit to the remote<br>repository because it took me a while to figure out how to authenticate<br>my gitbash with github. After reviewing the first module a few times and<br>doing some personal research, I figured out that if I re-traced my steps<br>I could resolve the issue. My issue was that I had super cluttered<br>files and I could not locate my original local repository that had the<br>authenticated ssh key. So I had to create a new file, one that<br>I knew where to find, and generate a new ssh-key and authenticate it.<br>After I resolved that issue, I was able to push and pull requests<br>between repositories and complete the assignment.<br></p><br></td></tr>
