<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The higherLower method successfully uses the guessed number variable (guess) and compares it<br>to the random number generated variable (number) and if one of those comparisons<br>fall true then it will tell the user to guess higher or lower.<br>I felt like this is an efficient way to implement this feature in<br>the NumberGuesser program.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The hotCold method successfully takes in the guess parameter and passes it into<br>a condition. Within that condition, if the difference of the number variable and<br>guess variable is less than or equal to 5, then user&#39;s guess is<br>considered warm. If the user&#39;s guess is 3 or less than the difference<br>of (guess - number), than the user&#39;s guess is hot. And any other<br>condition would result in the user&#39;s guess to be cold. The absolute value<br>must be taken from the difference because the random generated number can be<br>greater than the user&#39;s guess, resulting in a negative number.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I feel generally comfortable with logic and flow, creating methods and implementing them<br>into pre-written code. I mostly know what modifiers are and how they are<br>accessed and what their properties are. The file I/O lesson is a little<br>confusing and will take more practice to get a better grasp on what&#39;s<br>going on.<br></p><br></td></tr>
